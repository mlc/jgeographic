jgeographic
===========

A small collection Java routines for performing geodesic calculations.

This code is based almost entirely on the C++ [GeographicLib][] by Charles Karney. The Java port is at this point extremely preliminary (though it seems to be functional). Futher documentation is forthcoming.
